## üîé  Explore data and test model

### The Process is following - [Code & Presentation](https://github.com/anhtuan0811/Credit-Score/blob/main/Analyst.md) or [Only Code](https://github.com/anhtuan0811/Credit-Score/blob/main/Credit%20Score%20Project%20.ipynb) 

### Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Preprocess credit data to remove outliers using the IQR (Interquartile Range) and Standard Deviation methods.
2. Build and train a Random Forest model for credit prediction.
3. Build and train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for credit prediction.
4. Compare the performance of both models on the dataset.

# üßæ What can you practice with this case study?

  - pandas, numpy,matplotlib,seaborn.
  - Cleaning, check Null values, outliers, data types.
  - Running model, Fiting model, Testing model. 
  - Def function.
