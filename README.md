# Credit Score Project

This project uses Python to process credit data and make predictions with two Machine Learning models: Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Preprocess credit data to remove outliers using the IQR (Interquartile Range) and Standard Deviation methods.
2. Build and train a Random Forest model for credit prediction.
3. Build and train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for credit prediction.
4. Compare the performance of both models on the dataset.
